Users can play a range of 8 notes by touching fingers to thumbs.

## How to Play
Built using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe, the user can interact with the application by holding their hands up in front of their camera. The application will detect the user's hands and display a visual representation of the user's hands on the screen. The user can then play notes by touching their fingers to their thumbs.
